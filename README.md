# Welcome to mmr_cooperative!

## Backend and Front-end Code for the MMR Cooperative

This repository is designed to house everything we need for
a fantastic website. The `server` directory will house the web server 
and API code, the `client` directory will house the client javascript, 
and the `static` directory will house static content. The `ansible`
directory contains code for infrastructure deployment.

More directories and stuff will be added as we go along. I like
to use [ansible](http://www.ansible.com) to provision my web
servers, for instance, so we'll need a directory for that. We
can also use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to do automated
testing of our code, since this is an open source project, so
we'll need a `travis.yml`. I'll also include at some point some
documentation and resources for performing local testing and
development using either VMs/Vagrant or Docker.

Here's to beginnings!
